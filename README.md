# Employability after online Bootcamps

## Objective

The aim of this project is to estimate how long it takes, after completion of online Bootcamps at Digital House, to land a job. The objective is to predict the number of days that a graduated student will take to be hired.

## About the dataset

The dataset was provided by Digital House, and Argentine coding schools with more than 99,000 graduates, in the context of the 2020 IBM Behind the Code Hackathon.

The data is a graduate-level dataset that contains personal characteristics, performance in the Digital House course and the days after completion of the course the graduate took to find a job.
